Hey guys, welcome to my home page, I am not a web developer, hence this site is made by myself overnight, by copying the template the website of ben issacman and configuring it to my requirements. I made some changes like adding a dark and light mode. This satisfied my requirement which was just to have a up and running portfolio website. will make further improvemnets or change the website completely if required.
