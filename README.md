Hello everyone, and welcome to my home page. Because I am not a web developer, this site was created by copying a template from another website and configuring it to my specifications. 
You could say I made this in an overnight, but it took me two days, one to figure out the original website and the other to tweak it to my liking.
I made some modifications, such as adding a dark and light mode. This fulfilled my requirement of having a working portfolio website. 

This is temporary, in future, if necessary, I will make additional improvements or redesign the website entirely.
